# Odin-Project-Admin-Dashboard

My Admin Dashboard from the odin project.

Was really fun making this. My initial attempt looked pretty terrible so half way through I scrapped it and we for a much simpler color pallette and also decided to design it on my own rather that following the example they gave us to the t.

Decided to also learn tailwind while I was at it (only using the CDN right now, which isnt really good practice but seeing as this isnt actually being deployed it doesnt matter), which simplified things so much. I've only wrote 2 lines of css for this whole project, and thats just to remove the padding and margin added by the browser. It also made making the page responsive easier but harder at the same time. Let me explain: It was so much easier because there was no need to deal with media queries and repeat a lot of css in the process, but I had to think very logically to be able making specific things appear and dissappear for different screen sizes.

So far I'm pretty pleased with how the site looks and the code.

(NOTE DOESNT LOOK GREAT ON 2K SCREENS OR NEAR THE SM TO MD BREAKPOINT, TO FIX THAT I WOULD NEED TO ADD CUSTOM BREAKPOINTS WHICH WOULD TAKE TOO LONG SO IM LEAVING IT AS IT IS)
